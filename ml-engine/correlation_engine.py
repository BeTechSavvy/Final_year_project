"""
correlation_engine.py

The "Correlation & Storage Layer" from the architecture diagram.

A single real-world incident usually shows up as SEVERAL related
anomalies at once — e.g. a CPU spike + a memory spike + an error-rate
jump, all within the same couple of minutes. Left ungrouped, the
detector would report these as 3 separate anomalies, which is noisy
and unhelpful for a human (or an LLM) trying to diagnose what happened.

This module groups anomalies that are close together in time into a
single Incident object. That Incident is what gets stored (MongoDB)
and handed to the next layer (Root Cause Analysis / LLM Explanation).
