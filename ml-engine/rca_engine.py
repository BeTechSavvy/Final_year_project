"""
rca_engine.py

The "AI Intelligence Layer > Root Cause Analysis" and the entire
"LLM Explanation Layer" from the architecture diagram, combined.

Given an Incident (from correlation_engine.py), this module:
  1. Retrieves similar PAST incidents from ChromaDB (the "R" in RAG) —
     grounding the explanation in real history instead of the LLM
     guessing blindly.
  2. Sends the current incident + retrieved context to Gemini (the "AG"
     in RAG) to generate a plain-English summary, likely root cause,
     a confidence-worded explanation, and a suggested fix.
  3. Stores the current incident into ChromaDB too, so future incidents
     can be compared against it — the system gets smarter over time.

This is explicitly ADVISORY ONLY, matching the diagram's label
"LLM Explanation Layer - Advisory / Human-Reviewed (No Automation)".
Nothing in this file takes any healing action on its own.
