"""
api.py

A small Flask API that sits between MongoDB and the React dashboard.
The dashboard doesn't talk to MongoDB directly - it calls this API,
which reads incidents (with their attached diagnoses) and returns
them as JSON.

Run this alongside your detection pipeline:
    python api.py
It starts on http://localhost:5050
